## Stakeholders

### An NYU freshman 
**Problems/Frustrations:**  

1. Sometimes, when I want to study in Bobst Library, it’s hard to find a spot. I don’t know which areas are crowded and which are less busy.
2. I’d like to easily access library information through an app instead of having to quickly check the website. I also want to know the behavioral guidelines for each floor, such as food and drink policies or whether it’s a quiet space.
3. Sometimes, I need to use printers in the library, but I can’t figure out which printers are available or how long the waiting time is. Additionally, some of them are often out of order.

### A junior NYU student
**Problems/Frustrations:** 

4. I’m too shy to ask the librarian where a specific book is, which might be why I don’t borrow books from the library very often.
5. I often notice interesting events or exhibitions happening in the library, but I only find out about them through posters I see in person. I’d like to have a way to view ongoing events and exhibitions digitally.

### An NYU Faculty member:
**Problems/Frustrations:** 

6. There isn’t an easy way for me to communicate with other library users about things like lost and found, quick questions, or sharing research tips.

**Summary of Goals/Needs:**  
- The app should identify less crowded areas in the library, making it easier for users to find a study spot.
- The app should provide quick access to floor-specific behavioral rules, such as noise levels and food policies.
- The app should display real-time printer availability and status.
- The app should feature a book search tool to help users locate books independently.
- The app should offer a digital list of library events and exhibitions to keep users informed.
- The app should provide a communication platform for library users to connect regarding lost and found, quick questions, and sharing research tips.

## Product Vision Statement

Design a smart library service app that enhances the Bobst Library experience by providing real-time space availability, library guidelines, printer status, book navigation, and event updates.

## User Requirements

1. As a student, I want to view the real-time availability of study spaces so that I can find a quiet place to study.
2. As a freshman, I want to check the rules for each library floor so that I can choose the right place to work.
3. As an exhibitor, I want more students or faculty members to know about my exhibition in the library so that more people can enjoy the exhibition.
4. As an art student, I want to access ongoing exhibitions so that I can explore different artworks and find inspiration for my work.
5. As a teacher assistant, I want to know which printers are available when I arrive so that I won’t waste time checking for broken printers or those out of paper.
6. As a faculty member, I want to view the current academic workshops or events happening in the library so that I won’t miss the ones that interest me.
7. As a PhD student, I want to know where to find books in my field of study so that I can easily locate the resources I need for my research.
8. As a professor who often forgets things, I want to access information about the library’s lost and found so that I have a better chance of recovering my belongings.
9. As a student with upcoming midterms, I want to see the availability of printers so that I won’t waste time waiting in line and risk being late for my exams.
10. As a student who lives far from home, I want to borrow laptop chargers from other people so that I can continue my homework without interrupting everyone in the quiet library.
